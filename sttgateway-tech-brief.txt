Purpose of this toolkit
-----------------------
The streamsx.sttgateway toolkit provides the following two operators
that can help you to integrate an IBM Streams applicaion with the
IBM Voice Gateway product v1.0.3.0 or higher 
(https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4U29/whatsnew.html) at 
the point of data ingestion and with the IBM Watson Speech To Text (STT) 
cloud service (https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/speech-to-text/) at 
the analytic stage(s) of that application pipeline.

1) IBMVoiceGatewaySource
2) WatsonSTT

IBMVoiceGatewaySource is a source operator that can be used to
ingest speech data from multiple live telephone conversations
happening between different pairs of speakers
e-g: customers and call center agents.

WatsonSTT is an analytic operator that can be used to transcribe
speech data into text either in real-time or in batch mode.

In a Streams application, these two operators can either be
used together or independent of each other. In a real-time
speech analytics scenario for transcribing live voice calls into
text, both of these operators can be used as part of a
Streams application graph. In a batch mode operation to
convert a set of prerecorded audio files stored in a
file system directory into text, WatsonSTT operator can be
used on its own in a Streams application graph. So, your
application requirements will determine whether you will need
only one or both of those operators.

This toolkit excels at ingesting speech data from an enterprise
telephony infrastructure and from audio files (wav, mp3 etc.) as well
as in sending the speech data to the Watson STT service and
get back the transcription results. Based on the user preference,
this toolkit is designed to work with the IBM Watson STT service
available on the IBM public cloud or on the hybrid cloud ready
IBM Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D). It uses the Websocket communication
API interface to interact with both the IBM Voice Gateway and
the Watson STT service. So, processing of the audio data either from 
the real-time speech conversations or from the prerecorded speech 
conversations that are stored in files can be accomplished by this toolkit.

Architectural patterns enabled by this toolkit
----------------------------------------------
1) For the real-time speech to text transcription, following are the possible architectural patterns.

a) Your Telephony SIPREC-->IBM Voice Gateway-->IBM Streams<-->Watson Speech To Text on IBM Public Cloud
 
b) Your Telephony SIPREC-->IBM Voice Gateway-->IBM Streams<-->Watson Speech To Text on IBM Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D)
 
c) Your Telephony SIPREC-->IBM Voice Gateway-->IBM Streams<-->Watson Speech To Text engine embedded inside an IBM Streams operator

2) For the batch (post call) speech to text transcription, following are the possible architectural patterns.
 
a) Speech data files in a directory-->IBM Streams<-->Watson Speech To Text on IBM Public Cloud
 
b) Speech data files in a directory-->IBM Streams<-->Watson Speech To Text on IBM Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D)
 
c) Speech data files in a directory-->IBM Streams<-->Watson Speech To Text engine embedded inside an IBM Streams operator

Technical positioning of this toolkit
-------------------------------------
At a very high level, this toolkit shares the same design goal as the other 
IBM Streams toolkit named com.ibm.streams.speech2text to convert speech data 
into text. But, they both work very differently to realize that design goal.
IBM Streams users can select either of these two toolkits depending on their 
application and hardware infrastructure needs. So, it is important to know 
the following major differences between these two toolkits before choosing 
the suitable one for a given situation.

1) Namespace for them are different.
   --> com.ibm.streams.speech2text.watson (Wraps Rapid libraries)
   --> com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway.watson (Invokes the IBM Watson STT cloud service)

2) Full scope versus partial scope speech analytics.
   --> com.ibm.streams.speech2text.watson (Can only do speech to text)
   --> com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway.watson (Supports both
       live speech data ingestion and speech to text)
   
3) Self contained versus external service invocation.
   --> com.ibm.streams.speech2text is self contained. It includes
       the speech to text core libraries and a small number of base language 
       model files that are necessary to do the speech to text conversion.
       
   --> com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway relies on an external
       STT service. It contains the necessary code to communicate with
       the external STT service to get the speech to text conversion done.
       
4) Speech data stays within your application versus going outside.
   --> In com.ibm.streams.speech2text, audio content
       will not have to go outside of this toolkit.
       
   --> In com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway, Audio content will 
       go outside of this toolkit via the network to the 
       external service that can run either on the IBM public cloud 
       or inside your own private network in a Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D) cluster.

5) Ease of customizing the LM and AM models.
   --> In com.ibm.streams.speech2text, model customization 
       (for both LM and AM) requires the user to do the customization 
       on the IBM public cloud and then copy the generated
       custom model patch files into the Streams machine so that they are
       locally accessible by the Streams application.
       
   --> In com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway, LM and AM model
       customization is done using the IBM cloud tools/infrastructure.
       Such customized LM and AM models can be used via the
       WatsonSTT operator parameters without a need to obtain the
       copies of the generated custom model patch files into the
       Streams application machine.
       
6) Ease of switching between different language models and minimizing toolkit upgrade cycles.
   --> In com.ibm.streams.speech2text, it is necessary to 
       package relevant language base models (English, Spanish, French etc.) as
       part of this toolkit. This also implies that a toolkit upgrade will be
       needed for using newer versions of the models as well as the
       newer versions of the speech engine libraries.
       
   --> In com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway, there is no packaging of
       the language model files needed inside the toolkit.
       Switching between different language models is simply
       done through an operator parameter. There is no need to upgrade
       this toolkit for using the newer versions of the models as well as
       the newer versions of the speech engine libraries as they become
       available in the external Watson STT service.
       
7) Ease of using different audio formats.
   --> In com.ibm.streams.speech2text, it may be possible to
       use only WAV formatted audio data.
       
   --> In com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway, any supported audio
       format by the STT service can be used (mp3, WAV, FLAC, mulaw etc.)

8) Speech to text conversion performance.
   --> In the lab tests, both toolkits seem to provide the same
       level of performance in terms of the total time
       taken to complete the transcription of the given audio content.
       However, it is important to note that under certain
       batch workloads, the com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway seems to complete
       the transcription faster than the com.ibm.streams.speech2text.
       
9) Operator names.
   --> In com.ibm.streams.speech2text, WatsonS2T is the operator name.
       
   --> In com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway, IBMVoiceGatewaySource and 
       WatsonSTT are the operator names.

10) RPM dependency.
   --> In com.ibm.streams.speech2text, atlas and atlas-devel 
       RPMs for Linux must be installed in all the 
       Streams machines where the WatsonS2T is running.
       
   --> In com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway, there is no such RPM dependency.
       
11) CPU core usage.
   --> In com.ibm.streams.speech2text, every instance of the
       WatsonS2T operator must run on its own PE (a.k.a Linux process).
       Multiple instances of that operator can't be fused to 
       pack them into a single Linux process. This will
       result in using many CPU cores when there is a need to
       have a bank of WatsonS2T operators to achieve data parallelism.
       
   --> In com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway, there is no such
       restriction to fuse multiple WatsonSTT operators into a
       single PE (Linux process). This will result in the efficient
       use of the CPU cores by requiring fewer CPU cores to have
       a bank of WatsonSTT operators to achieve data parallelism.

12) Transcription result options.
   --> In com.ibm.streams.speech2text, the WatsonS2T operator can
       only return one full utterance at a time.
       
   --> In com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway, the WatsonSTT operator
       can be configured at runtime to return one of the following as
       transcription result.       
       1) Partial utterances as the transcription is in progress.
       2) Only finalized a.k.a. completed utterances.
       3) (default) Full text containing all the finalized 
          utterances after transcribing the entire audio.
       
13) Value added features.
   --> In com.ibm.streams.speech2text, the WatsonS2T operator can
       only provide the core speech to text capabilities.

   --> In com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway, the WatsonSTT operator
       can optionally provide a few value added features in addition to
       the core speech to text capabilities. Such features include
       smart formatting, profanity filtering, keywords spotting etc.

14) Limited versus free availability
   --> In com.ibm.streams.speech2text, the toolkit package containing the
       WatsonS2T operator can be downloaded only by the customers
       who possess active Streams licenses.

   --> In com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway, the toolkit package containing
       the IBMVoiceGatewaySource and the WatsonSTT operators can be 
       downloaded by anyone for free from the IBMStreams GitHub web site.

Requirements for this toolkit
-----------------------------
There are certain important requirements that need to be satisfied in order to 
use the IBM Streams STT Gateway toolkit in Streams applications. 
Such requirements are explained below.

1. Network connectivity to the IBM Watson Speech To Text (STT) service running 
either on the public cloud or on the Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D) is needed from 
the IBM Streams Linux machines where this toolkit will be used. The
same is true to integrate with the IBM Voice Gateway product for the
use cases involving speech data ingestion for live voice calls.
   
2. This toolkit uses Websocket to communicate with the IBM Voice
Gateway and the Watson STT service. A valid IAM access token is needed
to use the Watson STT service on the public cloud and a valid access
token to use the Watson STT service on the CP4D. 
So, users of this toolkit must provide their public cloud STT service instance's 
API key or the CP4D STT service instance's access token when launching the Streams 
application(s) that will have a dependency on this toolkit. When using the API key 
from the public cloud, a utility SPL composite named IAMAccessTokenGenerator 
available in this toolkit will be able to generate the IAM access token and then 
subsequently refresh that token to keep it valid. A Streams application employing 
this toolkit can make use of that utility composite to generate the necessary 
IAM access token needed in the public cloud. Please do more reading about the 
IAM access token from here: 
https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-websockets#WSopen

3. On the IBM Streams application development machine (where the application code is 
compiled to create the application bundle), it is necessary to install the toolkit. 
The toolkit release bundle contains all the required dependencies.
Please note that this is not needed on the Streams application execution machines.

4. On the IBM Streams application development machine the following toolkits are required:
* com.ibm.streamsx.inet version 2.3.6 or higher
* com.ibm.streamsx.json version 1.4.6 or higher

5. On the IBM Streams application machines, please ensure that the licurl is installed. 
This is required by the toolkit dependency to streamsx.inet toolkit. This is required 
by this toolkit to generate and refresh  and refresh the IAM access token which is a must 
for the STT service on public cloud.

6. For the IBM Streams and the IBM Voice Gateway products to work together, 
certain configuration steps must be done as explained here.

a) In order to make the IBM Voice Gateway send the speech data from the 
live voice calls, it is necessary to set the following environment variable in
the deployment configuration of the IBM Voice Gateway's SIP Orchestrator at the 
time of deploying it.

{
   "name": "SEND_SIPREC_METADATA_TO_STT",
   "value": "true"
}

b) It is also necessary to set the following environment variable in the 
IBM Voice Gateway's Media Relay deployment configuration to point to the 
URL at which the IBMVoiceGatewaySource operator is running.

{
   "name": "WATSON_STT_URL",
   "value": "https://<IP-Address-Or-The-Streams-Machine-Name-Where-IBMVoiceGatewaySource-Is-Running>:<Port>"
}

c) It is necessary to create a self signed or Root CA signed TLS/SSL certificate 
in PEM format and point to that certificate file at the time of starting the 
IBM Streams application that invokes the IBMVoiceGatewaySource operator present 
in this toolkit. If you don't want to keep pointing to your TLS/SSL certificate 
file everytime you start the IBM Streams application, you can also copy the full 
certificate file to your Streams application's etc directory as ws-server.pem 
and compile your application which will then be used by default.

d) You should also extract just the certificate portion without your private key 
from your full TLS/SSL certificate PEM file that you created in the previous step 
and then create a security credential in the IBM Voice Gateway container as 
explained in that product's documentation. After that, you should point to that 
security credential in the deployment configuration of the IBM Voice Gateway's 
Media Relay.

e) If you are comfortable with using a self signed TLS/SSL certificate file in 
your environment, you can follow the instructions given in the following file 
that is shipped with this toolkit to create your own self signed SSL certificate.

<YOUR_STTGATEWAY_TOOLKIT_HOME>/samples/VoiceGatewayToStreamsToWatsonSTT/etc/creating-a-self-signed-certificate.txt

Major external dependency for this toolkit
------------------------------------------

Note: The external dependencies are resolved during the toolkit build process and are 
shipped with the toolkit archive.

A must do in the Streams applications that will use this toolkit
----------------------------------------------------------------
a) You must add this toolkit as a dependency in your application.
   --> In Streams Studio, you can add this toolkit location in the
       Streams Explorer view and then add this toolkit as a
       dependency inside your application project's Dependencies section.
       
   --> In a command line compile mode, simply add the -t option to
       point to this toolkit's top-level or its parent directory.

   --> This toolkit provides secure access to the STT service by
       generating an IAM access token needed in the public cloud via a 
       utility SPL composite that can be invoked within a Streams application. 
       That composite IAMAccessTokenGenerator has a dependency on the 
       streamsx.json toolkit and to the streamsx.inet toolkit. So, it is necessary 
       to have the streamsx.json (v1.4.6 or higher) toolkit and the streamsx.inet (v2.3.6 or higher) 
       on your development machine where you 
       will build your application. In a command line compile mode, you 
       have to add the -t option to point to your streamsx.json toolkit directory.
       
b) --> In Streams studio, you must double click on the BuildConfig of
       your application's main composite and then select "Other" in the
       dialog that is opened. In the "Additional SPL compiler options", you must add
       the following.
 
       --c++std=c++11
       
   --> If you are building your application from the command line, please refer to the
       Makefile provided in the AudioFileWatsonSTT example shipped with
       this toolkit. Before using that Makefile, you must set the 
       STREAMS_STTGATEWAY_TOOLKIT environment variable to point to the full path of   
       your streamsx.sttgateway/com.ibm.streamsx.sttgateway directory. Similarly,
       you must set the STREAMS_JSON_TOOLKIT environment variable to point to
       the full path of your streamsx.json (v1.4.6 or higher) toolkit directory.
       And, you must set the STREAMS_INET_TOOLKIT environment variable to point to
       the full path of your streamsx.inet toolkit directory.
       To build your own applications, you can do the same as done in that Makefile.
       
   --> Please note that your IBM public cloud STT instance's API key will have to be
       provided via a submission time parameter into your application so that 
       your API key can be used to generate a new IAM access token within 
       the utility composite IAMAccessTokenGenerator mentioned above. 
       Since the IAM access tokens will expire after a certain time period, 
       it is necessary to keep refreshing it periodically. That utility composite 
       does that as well. This API Key is needed only when using the STT service on
       public cloud. If the STT service on the IBM Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D) is used,
       then the API key is not needed. Instead, a never expiring access token
       obtained from the CP4D STT service instance's web console should be used.

Common log messages generated by the Websocket library
------------------------------------------------------
There will be many log messages from the underlying C++ Websocket library
routinely getting written in the Streams WatsonSTT operator log files.
Such log messages are about making a connection to the Watson STT service,
disconnecting from the Watson STT service, receiving Websocket control frames
during the ongoing transcription etc. For example, in the absence of any 
audio data available for transcription for a prolonged period (30 seconds or more),
the Watson STT service will terminate the Websocket connection to better utilize 
its back-end resources. In that case, a set of messages as shown below will be logged. 

[2018-08-11 10:07:35] [control] Control frame received with opcode 8
[2018-08-11 10:07:35] [application] Websocket connection closed with the Watson STT service.
[2018-08-11 10:07:35] [disconnect] Disconnect close local:[1011,see the previous message for the error details.] remote:[1011,see the previous message for the error details.]

These messages are normal and they don't reflect any error in the 
Streams WatsonSTT operator. When the audio data becomes available later,
the WatsonSTT operator will reestablish the Websocket connection and continue
the transcription task. Only when you see any abnormal runtime exception
errors, you should take actions to diagnose and fix the problem.

Information for the installation of the external libraries (done by build script now)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bulk of the Websocket logic in this toolkit's operator relies on the
following open source C++ Websocket header only library.
https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp

Much of the Websocket logic here also follows the
Websocket client and server usage techniques explained in the
sample code snippets from the above mentioned websocketpp URL.

A great source of learning for Websocket++ is here:
https://docs.websocketpp.org/index.html

This toolkit requires the following two open source packages that are
not shipped with this toolkit due to the open source code distribution
policies. Users of this toolkit must first understand the usage clauses
stipulated by these two packages and then bring these open source packages 
on their own inside of this toolkit as explained below. This needs to be
done only on the Linux machine(s) where the Streams application development
i.e. coding, compiling and packaging is done. Only after doing that,
users can use this toolkit in their Streams applications.

1) boost_1_69_0
   --> Obtain the official boost version boost_1_69_0 from here:
           https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_69_0.html
   
   --> A few .so files from the boost_1_69_0/lib directory are
       copied into the impl/lib directory of this toolkit.
       (It is needed for the dynamic loading of these .so files
        when the Streams application using this toolkit is launched.)
       
   --> The entire boost_1_69_0/include directory is copied into
       the impl/include directory of this toolkit. [Around 200 MB in size]
       (It is needed for a successful compilation of the 
       Streams application that uses this toolkit. Please note that
       these include files will not bloat the size of that
       application's SAB file since the impl/include directory will not be
       part of the SAB file.)
       
2) websocketpp v0.8.1
   --> The entire websocketpp directory is copied into
       the impl/include directory of this toolkit. [Around 1.5 MB in size]
       (It is needed for a successful compilation of the 
       Streams application that uses this toolkit. Please note that
       these include files will not bloat the size of that
       application's SAB file  since the impl/include directory will not be
       part of the SAB file.)

Downloading and building boost_1_69_0
----------------------------------
a) Download and build boost 1_69_0 in the user's home directory by using the --prefix option as shown below:

Download boost_1_69_0 from this URL into your home directory: 
mkdir <YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY>/boost-install-files
cd <YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY>/boost-install-files
wget https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.69.0/source/boost_1_69_0.tar.gz   [Approximately 1 minute]

Extract boost_1_69_0 in <YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY>/boost-install-files:
cd <YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY>/boost-install-files
tar -xvzf <YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY>/boost-install-files/boost_1_69_0.tar.gz    [Approximately 5 minutes]

Bootstrap boost_1_69_0 and install it in your home directory using the --prefix option:
cd <YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY>/boost-install-files/boost_1_69_0
./bootstrap.sh --prefix=<YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY>/boost_1_69_0             [Approximately 1 minute]
./b2 install --prefix=<YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY>/boost_1_69_0 --with=all    [Approximately 25 minutes]
cd <YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY>
rm -rf <YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY>/boost-install-files         [Approximately 2 minutes]

Instructions shown above are from this URL:
https://gist.github.com/1duo/2d1d851f76f8297be264b52c1f31a2ab

b) After that, copy a few .so files from the <YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY>/boost_1_69_0/lib
   directory into the impl/lib directory of this toolkit.
   (libboost_chrono.so.1.69.0, libboost_random.so.1.69.0, 
    libboost_system.so.1.69.0
    
   For all those .so files you copied, you must also create a 
   symbolic link within the impl/lib directory of this toolkit.
   So, change directory to the impl/lib directory of this toolkit and 
   execute the Linux symbolic link command as shown below for every
   .so file you copied into that directory.
   
   e-g: ln -s libboost_chrono.so.1.69.0 libboost_chrono.so

c) Move the entire <YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY>/boost_1_69_0/include/boost directory into the
   impl/include directory of this toolkit.
   
d) At this time, you may delete the <YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY>/boost_1_69_0 directory.

Downloading websocketpp 0.8.1
-----------------------------
a) Download websocketpp v0.8.1 from https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases and 
   extract it in your home directory first. Then move the ~/websocket-0.8.1/websocketpp directory 
   into the impl/include directory of this toolkit.
   (websocket++ is a header only C++ library which has no .so files of its own.
    In that way, it is very convenient.)

b) At this time, you may delete the ~/websocket-0.8.1 directory.
